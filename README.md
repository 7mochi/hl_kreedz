# HL KreedZ

This repository contains AMX Mod X plugins for Half-Life jump servers, extended with several features for the SourceRuns AG jump server.

## hl_kreedz

hl_kreedz provides essential functionality such as start and stop buttons, timer and leaderboards.

## q_jumpstats

q_jumpstats monitors and records players' high scores in various types of jumps.

## searchmaps

searchmaps provides commands to search through the maps installed on the server, with an optional search term and pagination
For this version to work, you have to create an "allmaps.txt" file containing a map per line, with all the maps you want. You may want to create a script to dump all your maps directory into the file. It's planned to add a feature to this plugin that does the work for you.
